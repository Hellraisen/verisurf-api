# Verisurf API Introduction

The Verisurf API is provided to grant programmatic access to the functionality and data of the Verisurf desktop software.  This can be used to write automation routines or develop independent software that interfaces directly with Verisurf without using the Verisurf UI.

The interface for communication with Verisurf is handled through socket communication.  There is a TCP socket and WebSocket implementation available at this time.  This repository contains in depth sample code and documentation to cover the use of these interfaces.

Additionally we have hosted a number of sample applications on our website at http://sdk.verisurf.com
